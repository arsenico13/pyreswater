### Virtualenv

#### Notes

This software grew up as a personal command-line tool to help me in my workflow
with my photos. It does what it's supposed to do.
Right now is quite versatile (for a side project with no time dedicated to it)
but has some limitations.

Feel free to try it. I may enhance it when the time comes...
